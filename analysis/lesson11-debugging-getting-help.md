From [R for Excel users](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/collaborating.html#getting-help):

> Getting help, or really helping you help yourself, means moving beyond “it’s not working” and towards solution-oriented approaches. Part of this is the mindset where you **expect that someone has encountered this problem before** and that **most likely the problem is your typo or misuse**, and not that R is broken or hates you.

There is excellent advice for trouble-shooting R-code and how to get help in [Lecture 2 from ESM 206: Statistics and Data Analysis in Environmental Science and Management](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1DdhU_WTv1b-sbQgqVGAE-bA2Nq_Yym8BzcPW4lS3k/edit#slide=id.g619be0f969_0_27) by Allison Horst.
