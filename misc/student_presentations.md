Student presentation
================

## End-of-class student presentations

During our last class, we want to give you all the opportunity to share
ideas about how the skills we’ve learned in this course can be applied
in practice.

We would like each of you to give a *very brief* presentation showing
the rest of the class either

1)  One or several ways in which you have already implemented something
    from the class in your own work, or

2)  An overview of changes you plan to make in your workflow moving
    forward.

Please get as concrete as possible; don’t just talk in general terms,
but pull up RStudio or GitHub and show us some new code you’ve been
writing in tidyverse, the nice repo you’ve created for one of your
projects, or maybe even the new website you’ve set up. Alternatively, if
you’re using open science tools or strategies that we haven’t covered in
class, but you think could be of interest to others, feel free to focus
on those.

**When:** November 11 2020 during class  
**How long:** 1.5 mins per student  
**Who should do it:** A presentation is required from all students
taking the course for credit. If you can’t make it to the live Zoom
call, you can submit a video instead (due November 11). Auditors are
also welcome to contribute if they would like to share with the class
