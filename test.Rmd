## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the  **Knit**button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. *You can embed an R code chunk like this*:

This is some new 
```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# These are some secret notes
```



```{r cars, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

```{r pressure}

summary(pressure)


```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
